Cobalt/Emma/my ponies name á¯“ new nicknames ðŸš« (if idk you)

Booping constantly/covering intentionally bothers me

Color-dropping/copying/taking insp. ðŸš«

Don't associate my friends w/me. I don't agree w/everything they do/say

I'm bad at explaining + have a bad memory so I need refreshers sometimes

I believe my ocs are alive, feel their own things, have their own interests, etc

I block/hide freely if you meet my dni/harass me

If you have an issue w/me, reach out. I'd rather sort things civilly

I'm playful w/friends, but shy by myself and don't int first unless giving a crown

I'm usually zoomed in x4 or x6 so there's a chance I don't see you
