All my interests -> [â˜»](https://github.com/cobaltpngsituation/thefootsoldier) <-

<ins>BYI</ins>

Call me Cobalt, or my pony's name. New nicknames are prohibited.

Booping constantly/covering me bothers me

Color-dropping, copying, and taking insp. is prohibited.

Don't associate me with my friends. I'm myself, not them.

I believe my OCs are alive, feel their own things, have their own interests, etc

I block/hide freely if you have harassed me or meet my dni criteria

I can be blunt/brutally honest if smth is bothering me

If you have an issue with me, please reach out. I'd rather civilly sort things

I'm bad at explaining things + need refreshers sometimes

If I know you, I'm playful, but shy by myself and don't interact first.

I'm usually zoomed in x4, 6, or 8, so at first, I might not see you
