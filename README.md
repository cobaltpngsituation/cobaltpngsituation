ʙʏɪ

Call me Cobalt or Emma, pls. If idk you, new nicknames are prohibited

Intentional covering / repetitive booping bothers me (I don't believe in td/tts, but I'll move)

Colour-dropping, copying, or taking insp. from my ponies is prohibited

Don't associate my friends w/me pls. I don't agree w/everything they do/say.

I'm bad at explaining things + need refreshers sometimes

I believe my ocs are alive, feel their own things, have their own interests, etc.

I block hide/freely depending on whether you fit my dni criteria / harassed me

If you have an issue w/me, pls reach out. I'd rather sort things civilly.

I can be quite playful when with friends, but if I'm by myself, I'm shy and tend not to interact first (unless I'm giving a crown)

I'm usually zoomed in x4 or x6, so I might not see you unless you're close up

ᴛʜɪɴ ɪᴄᴇ

Enemies to lovers ships (I don't like this trope most of the time)

Politics (idc hearing abt it, but am not political)

The term 'femboy' and 'goon' (they make me uncomfy)
