ʙʏɪ

Call me Cobalt or Emma, pls. If idk you, new nicknames are prohibited

Intentional covering / repetitive booping bothers me (I don't believe in td/tts, but I'll move)

Colour-dropping, copying, or taking insp. from my ponies is prohibited

Don't associate my friends w/me pls. I don't agree w/everything they do/say.

I'm bad at explaining things + need refreshers sometimes

I believe my ocs are alive, feel their own things, have their own interests, etc.

I block hide/freely depending on whether you fit my dni criteria / harassed me

If you have an issue w/me, pls reach out. I'd rather sort things civilly.

I can be quite playful when with friends, but if I'm by myself, I'm shy and tend not to interact first (unless I'm giving a crown)

I'm usually zoomed in x4 or x6, so I might not see you unless you're close up

ᴛʜɪɴ ɪᴄᴇ

Enemies to lovers ships (I don't like this trope most of the time)
