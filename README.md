hey, i'm cobalt. i don't talk much, but i'm easy-going, and friendly.

don't associate me w/my friends. i don't agree w/everything they do or say

don't color-drop, copy, or take insp from my ponies

i can be blunt/honest if something's bugging me

i'm bad at explaining and have a bad memory, so i might need refreshers sometimes

i believe my ocs are alive, feel their own things, have their own interests, etc

i'm easier to speak to in whispers
