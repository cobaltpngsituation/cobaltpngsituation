hey, i'm cobalt. although i don't speak much, i'm generally easy-going and friendly.

don't associate me with my friends. i don't agree with everything they do/say.

don't color-drop, copy, or get inspiration from my ponies.

i can be blunt if something's bothering me

i'm bad at explaining and have a bad memory, so i might need refreshers if requested

i believe my ocs are alive, feel their own things, have their own interests, etc

i'm easier to speak to through whispers as i'm frequently off-tab
